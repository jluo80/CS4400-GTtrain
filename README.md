## Abstract

This project is our team project for CS4400 in Spring semester, 2016 at Georgia Tech. Our goal is to Analyze, specify, design, implement, document and demonstrate an application for buying train tickets at GTTrain.com. Basically this project involves the usage of classical methodology for database development. The system is using a relational DBMS(MySQL) that supports standard SQL queries.

## How to Run?

The techniques we use in this project are the Tinkter GUI library built-in Python3.5 and SQL language. We set up the database based on the relational schema and make up some data to test it. The database is setup in our school's server. If you want to run this code, just make sure you are using Python3 and the PIL and PyMySQL packages are installed. Then you can just download it and run it directly.
